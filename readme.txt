This project will use parallelism, not for speeding data computation, but for programming convenience. This is a month-by-month simulation of a grain-growing operation. The amount the grain grows is affected by the temperature, amount of precipitation, and the number of "graindeer" around to eat it. The number of graindeer depends on the amount of grain available to eat, and how many Hunters are hunting. 

To run:
